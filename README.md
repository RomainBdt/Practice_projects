# Practice_projects

This repository contains my practice projects for Python, specially in Data Science and Machine Learning.
The goal is just to get familiar with the language, some important concepts and tools and then apply them on real-world problems.
It is not meant to be a complete solution of every problem or even an efficient one.
I try to cite the source whenever I use it in my code and I am really thankful for all people who share their knowledge with me.
